## Contract-to-NPM Dependencies

### Who's Contract?

Your contract. Whether you wrote it or not. Contracts are public infrastructure. Use Loam and build frontends against any smart contract. With ease.

### Env You Can Rely On

In `development`, use `local` network. In `staging`, `testnet`. In `production`, `pubnet`. Use `environments.toml` to keep your team (and yourself) on-track.

### Easy As

`loam dev` watches your contracts—if you even need your own!—and your `environments.toml` file for changes, then automatically generates new, fully-typed NPM packages for all contracts you rely on, every time something changes.

### Convention Over Configuration

Don't re-invent the wheel. Building decentralized apps is hard enough without needing to rediscover every design consideration yourself. Use our conventions as a starting point; tweak them later if you need to.
