## An all-in-one solution

Loam powers full-stack smart contract authoring and interaction. You can think of it as the "Ruby on Rails of decentralized apps."

### 1. SDK

Create smart contracts using small, flexible building blocks called "subcontracts" with [Loam SDK](https://crates.io/crates/loam-sdk).

### 2. CLI

Command line interface built by the team that maintains the [Soroban CLI](https://github.com/stellar/soroban-cli). Create, build, deploy, and manage both contracts and frontend projects with ease. Get started with `cargo install loam-cli`.

### 3. Smart Contracts

A package manager for publishing versioned Wasm binaries; a contract registry which lets you deploy contracts and claim a named associated with its contract id; and a contract expiration tracker which will ensures that contracts won't expiration.

### 4. Frontend

Opinionated, modern frontend toolchain with declarative environment configuration to guide you from local development and testing, to staging, and finally to a production app backed by a live blockchain network.
