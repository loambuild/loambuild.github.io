## Smart deploys (and updates, and maintenance, andâ€¦)

### Universal Factory Contract

Have you deployed contracts? And initialized them? In one transaction? Not fun! Loam CLI paired with our stateless deployer contract makes it easy.

### Wasm Package Manager

Hashes are cool, but you know what's cooler? Names and versions. Version your own wasm binaries and/or rely on others'.

### Contract Registry

Give your contracts names! And use others' contracts by name. Our dream for the future? No more opaque contract IDs. Import contracts like you would any Rust crate.

### Keep it live

Automatically extend the lifetime of all your contract data with Loam's expiration tracker.
