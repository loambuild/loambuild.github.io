## An all-in-one solution

Loam powers full-stack smart contract authoring and interaction using a convention-over-configuration approach.

### 1. SDK

Create smart contracts using small, flexible building blocks called "subcontracts" with [Loam SDK](https://crates.io/crates/loam-sdk).

### 2. CLI

Command line interface built by the team that maintains the [Stellar CLI](https://github.com/stellar/stellar-cli). Create, build, deploy, and manage both contracts and frontend projects. Get started with `cargo install loam-cli`.

### 3. Contract Lifetime Management

A package manager for publishing versioned Wasm binaries, a contract registry to deploy named contracts, and an expiration tracker to keep your data live.

### 4. Frontend

Opinionated, modern frontend toolchain with declarative environment configuration. From local dev and testing, to staging, to a production appâ€”Loam has you covered.
