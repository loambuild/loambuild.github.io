## Why Build With Loam?

Loam powers full-stack smart contract authoring and interaction. You can think of it as the "Ruby on Rails of decentralized apps."

### 1. Loam SDK

Create smart contracts using smaller, more flexible building blocks called "subcontracts". All Loam contracts have safety, upgradeability, and composability baked into their core design.

### 2. Loam Frontend

An opinionated modern frontend toolchain paired with declarative environment configuration to help you progress from local development and testing to staging and finally to a production app backed by a live blockchain network.

### 3. Loam CLI

A command line interface built by the same team that maintains the official [Soroban CLI](https://github.com/stellar/soroban-cli). A powerful and easy-to-use companion to both the SDK and Frontend.
